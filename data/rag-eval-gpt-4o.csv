"To determine the percentage of the daily protein intake provided by a granola bar based on a 2000 calorie diet, we first determine the recommended daily protein intake. According to general dietary guidelines, protein should account for 10-35% of daily caloric intake. For a 2000 calorie diet, this equates to:

- 10% of 2000 calories = 200 calories from protein
- 35% of 2000 calories = 700 calories from protein

Each gram of protein provides 4 calories. Therefore:
- Daily protein intake in grams = 200 / 4 = 50g (for the low range)
- Daily protein intake in grams = 700 / 4 = 175g (for the high range)

The granola bar contains 8.0 grams of protein per 100 gram serving size.

The percentage of daily protein intake provided by the granola bar is calculated as follows for both the low and high range:

- (8g / 50g) * 100 = 16% (if the daily intake is 50g)
- (8g / 175g) * 100 â‰ˆ 4.57% (if the daily intake is 175g)

Therefore, the granola bar provides approximately 16% to 4.57% of the daily protein intake based on a 2000 calorie diet.",320,What percentage of my daily protein intake does this granola bar provide based on a 2000 calorie diet?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately calculates the percentage of daily protein intake that the granola bar provides based on the protein requirements for a 2000 calorie diet.
